 This example tests calculation of canonical TST rate constant (P = 1.0 above TS, zero otherwise).

 Based on Dubnikova, F.; Lifshitz, A. J. Phys. Chem. A 2000, 104, 19, 4489â€“4496.
 Isomerization of propylene oxide to acetone at T = 1000 K.
 To see isomerization rate constant from propylene oxide to propanal, see example #01_2
 Check NAST Manual, Chapter 5, example #1 for details.

  >>>>> Canonical TST rate constant at T = 1000 K <<<<<

   Dubnikova: k = 50.2 s-1 at barrier of 54.2 kcal mol-1
   Dubnikova: k = 83.1 s-1 at barrier of 53.2 kcal mol-1
   NAST code: k = 67.8 s-1 at barrier of 53.2 kcal mol-1 and maxn = 30000
