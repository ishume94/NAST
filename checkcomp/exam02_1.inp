 Cis-trans isomerization in but-2-ene.
 To check trans-cis isomerization in but-2-ene, see example #02_2

 This example tests calculation of canonical TST rate constant (P = 1.0 above TS, zero otherwise).
 This example specifically aims to compare the performance of NAST to MESMER, which stands for Master Equation Solver for Multi-Energy Well Reactions,
 version 6.0 [Glowacki, D. R.; Liang, C-H.; Morley, C.; Pilling, M. J.; Robertson, S. H. J. Phys. Chem. A 2012, 116, 38, 9545â€“9560].
 The input data, such as energies, vibrational frequencies, rotational constants (transformed to the moments of inertia for NAST) and other - were taken
 from the MESMER input file (cis_to_trans_But-2-ene.xml). Please note that in MESMER the relative energies are given with the ZPEs already included,
 while in NAST the ZPEs are calculated automatically from the corresponding vibrational frequencies.
 Check NAST Manual, Chapter 5, example #2 for details.

  >>>>> Canonical TST rate constants at various temperatures (given maxn = 40000) <<<<<

   MESMER: k(cis-to-trans) = 1.83 s-1 at T = 1000 K
   NAST:   k(cis-to-trans) = 0.65 s-1 at T = 1000 K

   MESMER: k(cis-to-trans) = 2.84 x 10^3 s-1 at T = 1300 K
   NAST:   k(cis-to-trans) = 1.17 x 10^3 s-1 at T = 1300 K

   MESMER: k(cis-to-trans) = 1.90 x 10^5 s-1 at T = 1600 K
   NAST:   k(cis-to-trans) = 1.32 x 10^5 s-1 at T = 1600 K
