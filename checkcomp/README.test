  Below are the instructions to test complilation of the NAST source code.

Please do the following:

1) Compile the NAST source code by

   1. cd ~/path-to-nast-code on your computer.
   2. Execute './configure.py --lib_path=/path/to/math_library'.
     (Execute './configure --help' to see all configure flags.)
   3. Execute 'make' and then 'make clean' (optional).
   
   You should now have the 'nast.x' executable in the installation directory.
 
2) Test compilation by executing the script 'checknast'

   (1. cd ~/path-to-nast-code on your computer.)
   2. cd checkcomp
   3. ./checknast

You should now see a running loop over the test examples. If successful,
an example will terminate with the '....Passed'. If the test results
differ from the pre-stored values, you will see that the test '....Failed'.
If an input file is corrupted, you will be recommended to verify your input.

Note: For test purposes, energy limits of some examples are lowered
to ensure passing of test examples. Feel free to increase
the maxn parameter to ensure convergence.
